The Anti-Popcorn Project
============

This is my personal site, it details some of my motivations, experiences, and skills. Link is [here](http://anti-popcorn.com/), please enjoy. If you are curious about the name, the idea came from thinking of new technologies as popcorn, just empty calories. 'Anti-Popcorn' is a rebellious title that serves as a reminder to work on technologies that have a positive impact in the world.
